# Word-Cloud-generator
Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word
indicates its frequency or importance. Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud.
Word clouds are widely used for analyzing data from social network websites.

This is a very basic attempt at generating a word cloud using available youtube comments on videos of popular
artists.(in csv format)
